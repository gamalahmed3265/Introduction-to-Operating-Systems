Assume that we want to compute the sum of all the elements in an `N X N ` matrix of
integers. The problem can be solved by a concurrent algorithm using threads. In this example, the main
thread first generates an N  N matrix of integers. Then it creates N working threads, passing as
parameter a unique row number to each working thread, and waits for all the working threads to
terminate. Each working thread computes the partial sum of a distinct row, and deposits the partial sum
in a corresponding row of a global array int sum[N]. When all the working threads have finished, the
main thread resumes. It computes the total sum by adding the partial sums generated by the working
threads. The following shows the complete C code of the example program
 C4.1. Under Linux, the
program must be compiled as
```
gcc C4.1.c â€“pthread
```
