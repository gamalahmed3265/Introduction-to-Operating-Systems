A FIFO file is a special type of file that can be used for inter-process communication. It is created using the `mkfifo()` system call and can be opened for reading or writing by multiple processes.

To use a FIFO file to communicate between processes in C, you can use the following steps:

1. Create the FIFO file using the `mkfifo()` system call.
2. Open the FIFO file for reading or writing in the process that will be doing the communicating.
3. Write or read data to or from the FIFO file as needed.
4. Close the FIFO file when you are done communicating.

Here is an example of a C program that uses a FIFO file to communicate between two processes:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main() {
  // Create the FIFO file.
  int fifo_fd = mkfifo("fifo", 0666);
  if (fifo_fd < 0) {
    perror("mkfifo");
    return 1;
  }

  // Open the FIFO file for reading.
  int read_fd = open("fifo", O_RDONLY);
  if (read_fd < 0) {
    perror("open");
    return 1;
  }

  // Read data from the FIFO file.
  char buf[1024];
  int bytes_read = read(read_fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
  if (bytes_read < 0) {
    perror("read");
    return 1;
  }

  // Print the data that was read from the FIFO file.
  printf("Read %d bytes from the FIFO file: %s\n", bytes_read, buf);

  // Close the FIFO file.
  close(read_fd);

  return 0;
}
```

This program will create a FIFO file called `fifo`. It will then open the FIFO file for reading and read data from it. The data that is read from the FIFO file will be printed to the standard output. Finally, the program will close the FIFO file.

You can use a similar approach to use a FIFO file to communicate between processes in any programming language that supports inter-process communication.
